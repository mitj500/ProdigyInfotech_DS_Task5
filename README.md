# ProdigyInfotech_DS_Task5

## Task
Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.
## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, converted data types, and ensured consistency across the dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzed the distribution and relationships of key variables to uncover patterns and insights.
3. **Visualization**: Created various plots and charts to visually represent the data and findings.

## Key Findings

- **City-wise Distribution**: Miami is the city with the most number of accidents, while Star Junction and Stromsburg have the least.
- **State-wise Distribution**: California has the highest number of accidents, whereas South Dakota has the least.
- **Yearly Trends**: The year 2021 saw the highest number of accidents.
- **Severity Levels**: Most accidents were classified at severity level 2.
- **Weather Conditions**: The majority of accidents occurred under fair weather conditions.
- **Time of Day**: Most accidents happened in the morning.
